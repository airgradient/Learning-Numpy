Vector/Matrix Production Functions

Some concepts

**Outer Product:**
> The tensor product of two vectors *u* and *v*. This can be written as *uv*<sup>*T*</sup>. When the length of *u* is m and the length of *v* is n, the result of outer producting *u* and *v* is an m * n matrix *w*, in which *w<sub>ij</sub>* = *u<sub>i</sub>* * *v<sub>j</sub>*

**Inner Product:**
> The summation of element-wise products of two equal-lengthed vectors. This can be written as *u*<sup>*T*</sup>*v*. The final result is a scalar. For example, *u* = (*u<sub>1</sub>*, *u<sub>2</sub>*, ... , *u<sub>n</sub>*), *v* = (*v<sub>1</sub>*, *v<sub>2</sub>*, ... , *v<sub>n</sub>*). Then *u* â€¢ *v* = \sum_{i=1}^{n}*u_i* * *v_i*
