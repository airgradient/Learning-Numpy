## Regulation of haematopoiesis in chronic inflammatory arthritis
Thibault Griseri
### Background
stem cells and progenitor cells just take up 1% of bone marrow
GMP are highly proliferative 
balance between HSC self-renewal and differentiation
especially during inflammation 
IFN gamma and alpha - quiescent HSC
### extramedullary haematopoiesis (during infection)
Spondyloarthritis (SpA) 5 - 10% of IBD patient develop SpA      Curdlan (beta-glucan) injection induces SpA
extramedullary GMP in the inflammed joints

### In other diseases
colitis - GMP leads to neutrophils and eosinophils 
## protein post-translational modification in autoimmune diseases
tolerance breakdown
1. incomplete removal of autoreactive T cells
2. lack of Tregs
3. similarity of pathogen antigen and self antigen
4. protein modifications
increased abundance of post-translationally modification (in RA)

## MicroRNAs and Cartilage - Chris Murphy
# What is miRNAs?
- small RNAs that can de-stablize the mRNA or interfere the translation of protein, which act as a negative regulator of gene expression
- _RISC complex_ helps miRNA to bind with their targets

# How to study
    - identify the important miRNAs in your system
        + screening
        + sequencing
    
    - uncover the direct target
        + bioinformatics
        + experiment

    - test function in vivo
        + transgenic mice
    
# In cartilage function
    - hypoxia increases cartilage matrix production
        HIF-2a -> SOX9 -> cartilage production
    - novel regulator - microarray to microRNA
        human articular chondrocyte (HAC) dedifferentiate in 20% oxygen and redifferentiate with 1% oxygen
    - miR-675 and H19 is also controlled during this period 
    - expression profiling can only find the phenotype after the miRNA interference (too many indirect targets)
    - RIP-seq (RISC Immunoprecipitation  + HT Sequencing) overexpress the miRNA 
    - 64 candidate genes are identified through this process
    - miR-675 binds to SOX9
    - in vivo functional test 
        miR-140 KO -> compacted cartilage and worn-out during aging
        miR-145 KO -> increased production of cartilage (chondroprotective?)

## DNA methylation 
# mechanism of DNA demethylation - passive and active
    - TET enzyme are active 5mC modifiers
    - TET cannot affect imprinted genes which bind with PGC7
# TET-assisted bisulfite sequencing can differentiate 5mC and 5hmC (hydroxymethylcytosine)

# non-coding RNA (ncRNA)
    _FANTOM project_: functional annotation of the mammalian genome
    imprinted gene clusters are accompanied by lncRNA
# two way for lncRNA to take effect
    direct transcription interference and indirect transcription interference
    transcription and heterochromatin formation, in both cis and trans styles

## Epigenetics modification
    MRC Career Development Fellowship - for training of computational group

# Definition of epigenetics - 
    - RA concordance in twins is low (12 - 20%)
    -   
    
# Epigenetic mechanisms

# Seq and bioinformatics

# Musculoskeletal epigenetics
