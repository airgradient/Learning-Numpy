## Regulation of haematopoiesis in chronic inflammatory arthritis
Thibault Griseri
### Background
stem cells and progenitor cells just take up 1% of bone marrow
GMP are highly proliferative 
balance between HSC self-renewal and differentiation
especially during inflammation 
IFN gamma and alpha - quiescent HSC
### extramedullary haematopoiesis (during infection)
Spondyloarthritis (SpA) 5 - 10% of IBD patient develop SpA      Curdlan (beta-glucan) injection induces SpA
extramedullary GMP in the inflammed joints

### In other diseases
colitis - GMP leads to neutrophils and eosinophils 
## protein post-translational modification in autoimmune diseases
tolerance breakdown
1. incomplete removal of autoreactive T cells
2. lack of Tregs
3. similarity of pathogen antigen and self antigen
4. protein modifications
increased abundance of post-translationally modification (in RA)
